# Game of Nim
## PLTW Activity 2.5.11

Over the next few days you will develop the game of Nim in your table groups by following the steps in the PLTW project instructions.
Please see the [project scoring guidelines](https://instructional-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/PLTW_Computer_Science/30181_ComputerScienceA/English_External_Files/CSA_2511_GameOfNim_ScoringGuidelines.pdf) for an overview of you your final project will be scored.  You will break up into subgroups of two, to practice pair programming for the creation of the game. If you are at a table with only 3 students, you may work as a group of three. If a student at your table is absent, you can work as a group of three until the student returns.

Log your table and links to your presentation and code base in [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K7GL03O6W0E8MbDVvkA6YDZWgq6mi-RH5SH1R1iR15I/edit?usp=sharing)

The scoring guidelines will be updated to require a unique feature.  See [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K7GL03O6W0E8MbDVvkA6YDZWgq6mi-RH5SH1R1iR15I/edit?usp=sharing) for ideas, and notes on the additional scoring metrics.

You must also use at least one construct from each of the units 2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3,  2.5.4, 2.5.5, 2.5.6, 2.5.7, 2.5.8, and 2.5.9 and explain how used in your presentation. If the sub-unit does not have specific constructs, for example 2.5.9, explain the teaching points from the sub-unit in the context of your program.

Steps 1-4 should be completed in class today (Monday, Nov 4) as a separate assignment.  All members of the table group can work together to create the list of nouns and verbs associated with playing the game.  You will then work in teams of two to develop 2 versions of the game, including creating the milestone chart (1 per sub group) and all other aspects of the game.  The milestone chart is also due today (1 for each subgroup), submitted as part of the first sub assignment. As part of your design, think about and make design notes about one unique feature that your subgroup can add to the  game.

On Tues, each subgroup must create a UML diagram that documents the entire program design (One UML box per class, that clearly shows the nouns (Instance variables, including type) and verbs(Method headers).  At the bottom of your UML diagram, include notes from step 5, that confirms that each feature meets one or more requirements and the feature is feasible. You will submit your UML diagram to a separate assignment on Tues.

Steps 6-9 plus the conclusion question will be documented in a google presentation that you will make to the class. Besides the steps outlined in the assignment, include 1 slide on your experience with the pair programming process, and one slide to present one unique feature that you added to your version of the game.  You may use replit in place of VS Code to facilitate collaboration, but must practice pair programming throughout the development process, and all code should be available as a git repo upon completion.  Your code walk through should compare your UML diagram to your actual code.

Your submission to this project will be to add a link to your google slides to this assignment, plus provide a link to the slides and your code base -as a github repository.  You will be asked to make a presentation, and participate in a gallery walk.

Student Eval Forms (these will be updated to reflect the requirement to include constructs or explanations from 2.5.1-2.5.9)
